<!-- //Event Flow or Propagation Methods
// Event flow is the order in which events are received on the web page. 
//it determines how events propagate or travel, routed and processed through the DOM tree
//handles events like User Interactions, GUI

//for handling/manipulating events, preventing/allowing default browser's behavior, event debugging, event order manipulation
//not useful for all events, but useful for some events like click, mouseover, mouseout, etc.
//useful in games, animations, drag and drop, etc.
//Two types: Event bubbling and Event capturing

// Event Bubbling: Be default, When an event is fired on an element, it first runs the event handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.
// Event Capturing: When an event is fired on an element, it first runs the event handlers on the ancestors, then on the element itself.

//There are three phases of event flow:
    // 1. Capturing phase: The event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.
    // 2. Target phase: The event has reached the target element.
    // 3. Bubbling phase: The event is propagated back to the outermost element.

// Event Propagation Methods
    // 1. stopPropagation(): This method stops the event from bubbling up the event chain.
    // 2. stopImmediatePropagation(): This method stops the event from bubbling up the event chain and prevents other event handlers on the same element from running.
    // 3. preventDefault(): This method stops the default action of an element from happening. -->
