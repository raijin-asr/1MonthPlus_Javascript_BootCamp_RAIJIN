    const btn = document.getElementById('btn');
    btn.addEventListener('click', function(e){
        console.log(e); //e is event object
        console.log(e.target); //target is the element that triggered the event
        console.log(e.target.id); //id of the element that triggered the event
        console.log(e.target.className); //class of the element that triggered the event
        console.log(e.target.classList); //list of classes of the element that triggered the event
        console.log(e.type); //type of event 
        console.log(e.clientX); //x coordinate of the mouse pointer when the event was triggered
        console.log(e.clientY); //y coordinate of the mouse pointer when the event was triggered
        console.log(e.offsetX); //x coordinate of the mouse pointer when the event was triggered relative to the element
        console.log(e.offsetY); //y coordinate of the mouse pointer when the event was triggered relative to the element
        console.log(e.altKey); //true if the alt key was pressed when the event was triggered
        console.log(e.ctrlKey); //true if the ctrl key was pressed when the event was triggered
        console.log(e.shiftKey); //true if the shift key was pressed when the event was triggered
    });

    //e.preventDefault() - prevents the default action of the event
    //e.stopPropagation() - stops the event from bubbling up the event chain
    //e.stopImmediatePropagation() - stops the event from bubbling up the event chain and prevents other event handlers from being executed
    //e.target - returns the element that triggered the event
    //e.currentTarget - returns the element that the event listener is attached to

    //Event Object Properties
    //bubbles - returns true if the event bubbles up the event chain
    //cancelable - returns true if the event can be cancelled
    //currentTarget - returns the element that the event listener is attached to
    //defaultPrevented - returns true if the preventDefault() method was called for the event
    //eventPhase - returns the phase of the event flow (1 = capturing phase, 2 = at target, 3 = bubbling phase)
    //isTrusted - returns true if the event is trusted
    //target - returns the element that triggered the event
    //timeStamp - returns the time when the event was created
    //type - returns the type of the event
    //view - returns a reference to the Window object where the event occurred
    //which - returns the key code of the key that triggered the event
    //x - returns the horizontal coordinate of the mouse pointer when the event was triggered
    //y - returns the vertical coordinate of the mouse pointer when the event was triggered
    
    //Event Object Methods
    //preventDefault() - cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur
    //stopPropagation() - stops the event from bubbling up the event chain
    //stopImmediatePropagation() - stops the event from bubbling up the event chain and prevents other event handlers from being executed
    //initEvent() - initializes the value of an event created
    //initCustomEvent() - initializes the value of a custom event created
    //preventDefault() - cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur
    //stopPropagation() - stops the event from bubbling up the event chain

    //Event Object Types
    //UIEvent - all events that occur in the browser are of the UIEvent type
    //MouseEvent - all events that occur as a result of mouse interaction are of the MouseEvent type
    //KeyboardEvent - all events that occur as a result of keyboard interaction are of the KeyboardEvent type
    //FocusEvent - all events that occur as a result of focus are of the FocusEvent type
    //WheelEvent - all events that occur as a result of mouse wheel interaction are of the WheelEvent type
    //InputEvent - all events that occur as a result of user input are of the InputEvent type
    //CompositionEvent - all events that occur as a result of composition are of the CompositionEvent type

    //AnimationEvent - all events that occur as a result of CSS animations are of the AnimationEvent type
    //DragEvent - all events that occur as a result of drag and drop are of the DragEvent type
    //ClipboardEvent - all events that occur as a result of clipboard interaction are of the ClipboardEvent type
    //CloseEvent - all events that occur as a result of a connection closing are of the CloseEvent type
    //ErrorEvent - all events that occur as a result of an error are of the ErrorEvent type
    //MessageEvent - all events that occur as a result of a message are of the MessageEvent type
    //FocusEvent - all events that occur as a result of focus are of the FocusEvent type
    //StorageEvent - all events that occur as a result of a storage change are of the StorageEvent type
    //ProgressEvent - all events that occur as a result of a progress are of the ProgressEvent type
    //PopStateEvent - all events that occur as a result of a history change are of the PopStateEvent type
    //PageTransitionEvent - all events that occur as a result of a page transition are of the PageTransitionEvent type
    //PointerEvent - all events that occur as a result of a pointer interaction are of the PointerEvent type

    //Pointer Event is new in HTML5
    //PointerEvent - all events that occur as a result of a pointer interaction are of the PointerEvent type
    //traditionally, mouse events were used to handle pointer interactions
    //it takes all mouseEvent and touchEvent properties

    //Pointer Event Properties
    //pointerId - returns a unique identifier for the pointer
    //width - returns the width of the pointer's contact geometry
    //height - returns the height of the pointer's contact geometry
    //pressure - returns the normalized pressure of the pointer input in the range 0 to 1
    //PageX - returns the horizontal coordinate of the pointer relative to the whole document
    //PageY - returns the vertical coordinate of the pointer relative to the whole document
    //clientX - returns the horizontal coordinate of the pointer relative to the viewport
    //clientY - returns the vertical coordinate of the pointer relative to the viewport

    //Pointer Event Methods
    //getCoalescedEvents() - returns an array of all touch events that have occured since the last event was fired
    //preventDefault() - cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur
    //stopPropagation() - stops the event from bubbling up the event chain
    //stopImmediatePropagation() - stops the event from bubbling up the event chain and prevents other event handlers from being executed

    //just simple event object practice
    document.addEventListener('click', (e)=>{
        console.log(e);
        console.log('$e(e.clientX, e.clientY)');
        console.log('$e(eScreenX, eScreenY)');
        e.target.innerHTML = 'Clicked'; //using target to change text
        e.target.style.backgroundColor = 'red'; //using target to change background color
    });
