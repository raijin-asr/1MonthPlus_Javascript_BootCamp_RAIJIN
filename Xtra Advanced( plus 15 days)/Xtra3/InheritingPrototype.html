//Prototype Inheritance: prototype inheritance is a feature of javascript where an object inherits properties and methods from another object
//it is a way to create a new object based on an existing object
//it is a way to reuse code
//it is a way to create a parent-child relationship between objects
//it is a way to create a chain, hierarchy of objects

//creating proto object
const proto= {
    slogan: function(){
        return "This is the best company";
    },
    changeName: function(newName){
        this.name = newName;
    }
}

//creating object
const obj1 = Object.create(proto);  //create object obj1 from proto object
obj1.name = "Ameer";
obj1.role = "Programmer";
console.log(obj1);
console.log(obj1.slogan()); //This is the best company
obj1.changeName("Ameer Khan"); //change name
console.log(obj1); //name changed

//another way to creating same object
const obj2 = Object.create(proto, {
    name: {value: "Ameer2", writable: true},
    role: {value: "Programmer2"}
});
console.log(obj2);
obj2.changeName("Ameer Khan"); //change name: becuase writable is true 


//Inheriting prototype from one object to another object
function Employee(name, salary){  //create Employee object
    this.name = name;
    this.salary = salary;
}

//inherit prototype from proto object to Employee object 
Employee.prototype.slogan = function(){ //inherit slogan from proto object
    return `This company is the best. Regards, ${this.name}`;
}

let emp1 = new Employee("Ameer3", 100000);
console.log(emp1.slogan()); //This company is the best. Regards, Ameer
console.log(emp1); //Employee {name: "Ameer3", salary: 100000}

//Developer
function Developer(name, salary, language){ //create Developer object
    Employee.call(this, name, salary); //inherit Employee object, call() method is used to call a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually
    this.language = language; //set extra property language to Developer object 
}

Developer.prototype = Object.create(Employee.prototype); //inherit Employee prototype to Developer object

let ram=  new Developer("Ram", 200000, "Javascript");
console.log(ram); //Developer {name: "Ram", salary: 200000, language: "Javascript"}
console.log(ram.slogan()); //This company is the best. Regards, Ram


//manually set constructor
Developer.prototype.constructor = Developer; //set constructor to Developer object to show constructor name in console
console.log(ram); //Developer {name: "Ram", salary: 200000, language: "Javascript"}
