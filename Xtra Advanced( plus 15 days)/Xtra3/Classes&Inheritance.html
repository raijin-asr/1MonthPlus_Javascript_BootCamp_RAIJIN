//Classes and Inheritance: classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.
//Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming where an object or class is based on another object or class, using the same implementation or specifying implementation to maintain the same behavior.
//Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class.

//Classes
class Rectangle {
    constructor(height, width) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
    }
}

//Inheritance
class Square extends Rectangle {
    constructor(sideLength) {
        super(sideLength, sideLength);
    }
}

const square = new Square(5);

console.log(square.height); // 5
console.log(square.width); // 5
