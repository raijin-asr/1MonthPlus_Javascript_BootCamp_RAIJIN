    <!-- Custom events are events that are created by the user. 
    They are useful when you want to create your own events and handle them in your code. 
    You can create custom events using the Event constructor and dispatch them using the dispatchEvent() method. 
    Here is an example that demonstrates how to create and dispatch a custom event: -->
    <!-- It is inherited from Event class.
    it can work for DOM manipulation and own event without any DOM manipulation. -->
    <!-- not fired by browser and also known as synthetic event. -->

    <button id="btn">Click me</button>

    <script>
        // Syntax:
        let customEvent = new CustomEvent('newCustomEvent'); //creating custom event
        document.addEventListener('newCustomEvent', function() {
            console.log('Custom event fired');
        });

        document.dispatchEvent(customEvent); // Custom event fired

        let btn = document.getElementById('btn');
        //custom event with two arguments
        let customEvent2 = new CustomEvent('personDetail'
        , {
            detail: { //detail has to be there as object format when two arguments are there.
                name: 'John',
                age: 25
            }
        }); //creating custom event

        btn.addEventListener("personDetail", function(e){
            console.log('Custom event fired with detail: ', e.detail);
        });

        btn.dispatchEvent(customEvent2); // trigger Custom event fired with detail:  {name: "John", age: 25}

        //example
        var event = new Event('build');
        document.addEventListener('build', function(e) {
            console.log('Custom event fired');
        });

        document.dispatchEvent(event); // Custom event fired
    </script>
