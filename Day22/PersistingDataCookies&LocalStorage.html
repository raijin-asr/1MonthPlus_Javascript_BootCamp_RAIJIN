    <!-- persisting allows to keep data available even after the page is reloaded -->
      <!-- or even user refreshes page, closes or reopens the browser or navigates away and return -->
       <!-- 1. Session Management
       2. User Preferences(languages, themes, etc)
       3. Tracking and Analytics

       1. Session Management
         - Session management is the process of keeping track of a user's activity across sessions.
            - A session is a series of requests made by a user within a certain time frame.
            - Sessions are used to keep track of user activity and store user data.

        2. User Preferences
            - User preferences are settings that a user can customize to make their experience more personalized.
            - User preferences can include things like language, theme, font size, etc.
            - User preferences are stored on the client-side so that they persist across sessions.

        3. Tracking and Analytics
            - Tracking and analytics are used to collect data about user behavior and activity.
            - This data can be used to analyze user behavior, improve user experience, and make data-driven decisions.
            - Tracking and analytics data is stored on the client-side so that it persists across sessions.
